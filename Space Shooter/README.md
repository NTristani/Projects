# SUBMISSION FOR DELTA HACKS 2015

Winner of the Mac GDA Game Development Award

While attending deltaHacks 2015, my team and I were faced with a task to create a project that was new, fun, and could contribute to society, in 24 hours. We decided to try something completely new and out of comfort zone, and concluded that we wanted to make some sort of game using Leap Motion and Unity. Leap Motion is a hardware sensor device that supports hand and finger motions as input, analogous to a mouse, but requiring no hand contact or touching. Unity is a multi-platform game engine that uses 3D graphics processing and a integrated development environment to create games for mobile, websites, consoles, and desktop.This game would in essence allow the player to interact with a player-controlled object, and use his/her own hand to also interact with the game, using sensors from the Leap Motion device. Our goal for this project was to emphasize the idea of interactive and hands on learning, using computers. The game consisted of a space ship that you would control using the keyboard, and you would have to move around quickly to avoid the asteroids that were falling down. We used Leap Motion to integrate a more interactive aspect, as you could now use your hand to hit away the asteroids that kept continuously falling, while simultaneously shooting and avoiding asteroids. We finished the contest off with an award from McMasters Game Development Association.
