# Final Project For Graphics Year 3

The goal of this project was to solidify game development principles learned. The task was to use those rules and principles and make a full functioning game that has a start, finish, clear goal, and resonable difficulty inbetween. Any free to use assets found online can be used.

Works with linux with all openGL, Glut, and make repositories installed

Mostly works on Macs with dev tools (opening screen will not load on Mac)

Run in terminal with make
