# Final Project Submission for 2XB3

The goal of this project was for each group to create an application that can take advatage of online databases of 10K or more lines.

We decided on using a database of online food reviews. We then created a simple to use UI. This would allow users to easily look up the food they were interested in trying. We then ran bayes algorithm on reviews for that product to detirmine what the average reviewer thought of that product.
